# gal  
## Genetic Algorithm Lightweight Implementations  
* Serial - Language C    
* OpenMP - Language C  

### For C implementations
*  configure the GA from defines in "ga.h", compile and use the configured GA.   
* You only need to recompile in order to change the algorithm configuration.  

### C Configuration Options  
* DEBUG_MODE  
* Resolution: 8,16,32 and 64 Bits  
* Stopping Criterion  
* Population Initial Size     
* Population Maximum Size
* If the population is constant or variable  
* Elit percentual  
* Selection Types: Roulette, Normal or Random(Educational)  
* Crossover One or Two Point  
* Crossover Rate  
* Mutation Probability
